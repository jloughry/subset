20140115.1225: add Eric Burnett as co-author; he wrote the code
that generates Banker sequences.

Notes for the revision of the subset paper:

In the Abstract, and again in section 2.3 (The Banker's Sequence),
the algorithm in this paper is more efficient than lexicographic
ordering for sets of more than 2 elements.  That could actually
be proved as a theorem, but it's probably not worth doing.

In section 2.3, the example sequence presented is backwards; it
should be shown in increasing, not decreasing order: 0, 1, 2, 4,
8, 16, 32, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, etc.

Also, show more examples than just n=6.

In section 3, `...the banker's sequence (lower case) is guaranteed
to find the smallest subset... AND IT WILL FIND SMALLER SOLUTIONS,
e.g., $k \le 10$ much sooner than either lexicographic or gray code
ordering.

Finally, fix the exposition of the algorithm, show it in a
functional style, and submit this puppy somewhere for publication.

Have to contact Jano first.

Where is the source code and figures?
